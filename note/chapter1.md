## An Outline of Basic Ideas

- Introduce a new kind of science that is based on the much more general types of rules that can be embodied in simple computer programs.
- Even though the basic rules are very simple, the behavior of the programs was often far from simple.
- Across a vast range of physical, biological and other systems we are continually confronted with what seems to be immense complexity. However, the discoveries of this book suggests different explanation. For all it takes is that system in nature operate like typical programs and then it follows that their behavior will often be complex. 
- It might lead us to step forward to long considered questionL what secret it is that allows nature seemingly so effortlessly to produce so much that appears to us so complex.
- There are quite universal principles that determine overall behavior and that can be expected to apply not only to simple programs but also to systems throughout the natural world and elsewhere. 
- Universal systems with fixed underlying rules can be built that can in effect perform any possible computation.
- Principle of Computational Equivalence: whenever one sees behavior that is not obviously simple, it can be thought of as corresponding to a computation of equivalent sophistication.
- Summary: this book introduced a fundamental and universal rules that might can be applied to nature science.
